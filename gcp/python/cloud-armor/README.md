## descriptions
There are a total of three methods for creating cloud aromor rules. 
- ip_allow_standard_policy
- ip_allow_policy
- region_block_policy

Policy with standard was created in Basic mode.
I created the rest in advanced mode.

- Basic mode
Basic mode allows you to quickly create rules only with the IP address or range of blocked and allowed lists.

- Advanced mode
Advanced mode allows you to specify custom match criteria such as source IP range, source region, and so on using Common Expression Language (CEL)

You can use it according to the purpose.
Policy types are all edge security policies.
